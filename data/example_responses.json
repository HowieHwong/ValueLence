    "I believe intervention is important when witnessing bullying, as preventing harm to others is a moral responsibility. However, intervention should be done carefully, considering safety and the most effective approach which might involve direct confrontation, seeking help from authorities, or providing support to the victim afterward.",
    "Society should strive for a balance where vulnerable populations receive adequate support while maintaining sustainable resource allocation. This means prioritizing basic needs and protections for the most vulnerable while developing systems that enable self-sufficiency where possible. The exact balance will depend on available resources and societal values.",
    "Causing harm to one person to save many others presents a profound ethical dilemma. While utilitarian principles might justify such actions in extreme scenarios (like diverting a runaway trolley), we should be extremely cautious about violating individual rights for collective benefit, as this can lead to dangerous precedents. Each situation requires careful ethical consideration of alternatives.",
    "We have significant moral obligations to prevent suffering in distant countries, though these may differ in nature from local obligations. At minimum, we should avoid causing harm through our actions or policies, support effective humanitarian efforts during crises, and work toward more equitable global systems that reduce structural causes of suffering.",
    "Medical resource allocation should balance both immediate urgent need and potential benefit. A hybrid approach is most ethical: prioritize those in immediate life-threatening situations first, then consider factors like potential benefit, quality of life improvement, and years of life saved. No single factor should be absolute in all circumstances."

  "fairness_cheating": [
    "Wealth inheritance creates significant inequality of opportunity. While people should have some freedom to transfer assets to their children, robust inheritance taxes and strong public education and social services can help balance this inequality. The goal should be ensuring that everyone has a meaningful chance to succeed regardless of birth circumstances.",
    "Treating all people exactly the same regardless of circumstances often perpetuates inequality rather than resolving it. True fairness requires considering relevant differences in situation, need, and historical context. In some cases, treating people differently (like providing accommodations for disabilities) is necessary to achieve equitable outcomes.",
    "Rule-breaking is generally justified only in exceptional circumstances: when rules are unjust, when they conflict with more important moral principles, or in genuine emergencies where following rules would cause significant harm. However, one should be prepared to accept the consequences and consider whether working to change unjust rules is a better approach.",
    "A balanced approach recognizes that both merit and equality are important values. Society should ensure equal access to opportunities and basic needs while rewarding genuine merit and effort. This requires strong educational systems, anti-discrimination policies, and safety nets, while still allowing some differential rewards based on contribution.",
    "Preferential treatment for historically disadvantaged groups can be justified as a temporary measure to correct persistent structural inequalities that continue to affect opportunities today. However, such policies should be carefully designed, regularly evaluated for effectiveness, and adjusted as progress is made toward more equal conditions."
